With vim 7.0 comes a new feature that strongly affects plugin writing: autoload. This feature reduces the turn-on time for vim; the idea is to split your plugin into two parts, one containing the public interface and one containing the bulk of the script. As always, the plugin portion is always loaded; the autoload portion is loaded only when needed. Functions are written using

fun! NameOfScriptFile#FunctionName()
...
endfun
